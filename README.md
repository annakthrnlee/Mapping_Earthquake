# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Approach
Incorporated the JavaScript and D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes from GeoJSON data. Also, used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Findings
As you can see from the image below, my map incorporates unique and fun colors to portray the different data findings represented throughout the world on past earthquakes!

### Map Key:
- Tectonic plate data (pink line)
- The circle markers are based on the magnitude of the earthquake (various pink bubbles) 
- The popup markers represent each earthquake and display the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer (blue markers)

### Map Features: 
- Street and Satellite view options are available
- An option to switch between earthquakes, tectonic, and major earthquakes for an easier visualization component 
- A zoom feature to make the map bigger and smaller

### For Learning Purposes:
I created different branches that display the codes for each unique step I used to create my final map. The first branch (Simple_Leaflet_Map) displays the code I used to create the basic map with no features. As you work you way up from there, each map displays different customizations that all played a role in my final project. Be sure to look through those codes and try to create your very own map!
